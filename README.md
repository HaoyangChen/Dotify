## Description
This app shows a music player app that displays a list of songs. In this list, the users can see the album's cover, song titles, and artist names. The user can select a particular song in the list, and click on the mini player container to view that particular song's album art, title, artist name, number of plays, and some media control buttons. The user can interact with the media control buttons to change users, increase the number of plays, and change the color of text. The user can also remove a song from the list by long pressing that song.
