## Description
This app shows a music player app that displays a list of songs. In this list, the users can see the album's cover, song titles, and artist names. The user can select a particular song in the list, and click on the mini player container to view that particular song's album art, title, artist name, number of plays, and some media control buttons. The user can interact with the media control buttons to change users and increase the number of plays.

## Implementation
Rebuilt the app using a single activity and fragments. Utilized activity lifecycle & back stack to ensure the consistency of data/state during the rotation of phone. Created a landscape layout for the rotation.
